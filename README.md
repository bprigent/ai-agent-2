# Second AI Agent Project

## Goal of the project
We will be building an AI agent that keeps the context of the conversation in mind and uses it to generate a response. We will build some basic tools for the ai agent. We will test different LLM models to see which one is the best fit for the ai agent. We will be using smolagent from Hugging Face.
